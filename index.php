<h1> My first, probably, but maybe not, in a long time at least, header. </h1>
<h2> Is this header bigger, smaller or equal to the first one? </h2>
<h3> The answers is... SMALER! </h3>
<h1> how about now? </h1>
<h1> now is the same size as the first one, as the tag was h1, it looks like it decreases with each level, but I don't know to what extent... </h1>

I am pretty sure i've already done a paragraph before, but I was young and naive, ten years ago maybe!! I should have kept track!! I can't just imagine where I would be right now if I had not changed my path... And now look at me, in the walk of shame, comming back to where I was. Maybe it's true, what goes around, indeed come backs around.
</p>
<p>
But I am still young and I have a lot of plans for my future, so, why not keep studying and learn something that I could have learnt  years ago but didn't? I already done the walk of shame, now it's just the neverending run.
</p>
<p>
Now I am super motivated, and I admit, installing MacOS gave me a weird nostalgia, I ean, I've never had a Mac, so how can I feel this way? but anyway, as I am motivated, I will now listen to some of my favorite songs:><br>
<a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM"> This one from Queen </a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY0WxgSXdEE"> Also from Queen </a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ"> Ok, maybe I like Queen a little too much (they're good though) </a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyHNuVaZJ-k"> Now some Gorillaz! <a/><br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq7Ovshz1UI"> This one is pretty awesome </a>
</p>

	This one is pretty weird as it will not only see the characters, but also the
formating, even if it is a litt-
le crazy. The font also changes!
</pre>
<p>
Okay is less than I expected because I got stuck at apples stupid OS.
but I will go on!!!
</p>
<p>
  Just done it!! it's on!! now I just have to solve a problem with my Xubuntu guest and all will be done! and I will start now with special characters.
</p>

  esse é um teste para o caracter  que também pode ser representado por &amplt. Algumas vezes é necessário buscar o "html code" para fazer funcionar, como por exemplo o ponto e vírgula após o menor precisa do código &amplt&#35;59 &lt&#59;
</p>
<p>
  Os símbolos também podem estar em links, como por exemplo esse:<br>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wa4e.com/code/html/special.htm"> &clubs;&hearts; </a>
</p>
<p>
<img src="cat.png" />
</p>
